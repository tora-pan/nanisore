## Background

The idea for `nanisore` came about after I connected with the maintainer of [rikaikun](https://github.com/melink14/rikaikun) and started contributing to the project. I showed many friends and family members and one in specific asked if I could make her something similar but for learning English as a Japanese native.  
<br>
`nanisore` is exactly that!
<br>  
A way for Japanese natives to accelerate their English studies and help them with the day to day obstacles with learning English.

### Current Goals

- Finish getting the project bootstrapped.
- Flesh out the initial feature goals.
- Set up tests and begin implementation.
